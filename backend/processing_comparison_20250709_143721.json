FATHER Millions of years ago, a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it. The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals affected by vibranium. FATHER And when the time of man came, five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength, speed, and instincts. A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands from the sand animation, and we see them unite, and then break apart as conflict arises. Bashenga rises above the conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite the tribes. FATHER The warrior became King and the first Black Panther, the protector of Wakanda.",

KILLMONGER This is it for you, cousin. T'Challa turns towards the train and sees that it is about to end. He lets Killmonger swing towards him and dodges, backing up even closer to the edge of the track, and Killmonger swings again - but this time T'Challa punches Killmonger's arm, jarring the blade lose and sending it flying up into the air. T'Challa then does a ROLLING ARM BAR TAKEDOWN as the BROKEN SPEAR flips through the air. We track with the spear as the SONIC STABILIZATION FIELD turns off, and the train passes the two fighters. As the BROKEN SPEAR drops T'Challa catches it with his right hand and slams it into Killmonger's chest, just as both their suits form around them. Killmonger removes his helmet, then looks down at the blade that is buried in his chest. T'Challa, realizing this is it, removes his mask as well. KILLMONGER Hell of a move. Killmonger struggles to breathe. KILLMONGER",
