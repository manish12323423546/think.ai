INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH (20s, energetic) sits at a corner table, typing furiously on her laptop. The coffee shop is bustling with CUSTOMERS.

SARAH
(to herself)
Come on, just one more paragraph...

The door chimes as JAMES (30s, disheveled) enters, looking around nervously.

JAMES
(approaching counter)
Large coffee, black. Make it a double.

BARISTA
(cheerfully)
Sure thing! Having a rough morning?

JAMES
(glancing at Sarah)
Something like that.

Sarah looks up from her laptop, notices James staring.

SARAH
(suspicious)
Can I help you?

JAMES
(walking over)
Actually, yes. I think we need to talk.

SARAH
(closing laptop)
About what?

JAMES
About the missing files from your company's server.

Sarah's face goes pale.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Through the window, we see Sarah and James in heated conversation. Other customers start to notice.

SARAH
(standing abruptly)
I don't know what you're talking about.

JAMES
(grabbing her arm)
The security footage says otherwise.

Sarah pulls away and heads for the door.

INT. SARAH'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

Sarah drives frantically, checking her rearview mirror. James follows in his car.

SARAH
(on phone)
Pick up, pick up...

VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
This is Detective Martinez.

SARAH
(panicked)
I need help. Someone's following me.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

Sarah's car pulls into an abandoned warehouse area. James's car follows.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Sarah enters cautiously. It's dark, filled with old equipment and shadows.

SARAH
(calling out)
Hello? Anyone here?

James appears from behind a stack of crates.

JAMES
(revealing badge)
FBI. Sarah Chen, you're under arrest.

SARAH
(shocked)
FBI? But I thought...

JAMES
The files you downloaded contained classified information. We've been tracking you for weeks.

Sarah drops her laptop bag, realization dawning.

SARAH
(defeated)
I just wanted to expose the corruption...

JAMES
(sympathetic)
That's not how this works. But if you cooperate...

Sarah nods slowly as James approaches with handcuffs.

FADE OUT.
