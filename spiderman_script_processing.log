NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - DAWN\nThe sun rises over Manhattan's towering skyscrapers. The city awakens as early commuters \nfill the streets below.\n\nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN\nPETER PARKER (20s), disheveled hair, jolts awake to his phone's alarm. Spider-web cracks \nspread across his phone screen. He groans.\n\nPETER\nNot again...\n\nHe reaches for the broken phone, accidentally sticking it to his palm with his \nweb-shooters.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\n(sighs)\nGreat. Just great.\n\nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING\nPeter hurriedly makes coffee, moving with enhanced agility. He catches a falling mug \nmid-air without looking, then realizes what he's done.\n\nPETER\nFocus, Parker. Be normal.\n\nHis AUNT MAY (60s) enters, fully dressed and energetic.\n\nAUNT MAY\nMorning, sleepyhead. You're going to be late for your interview at the Bugle.\n\nPETER\nRight! The interview. I completely forgot—\n\nHis spider-sense TINGLES. Peter's head snaps toward the window.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\n(distracted)\nActually, Aunt May, I might need to—\n\nA massive EXPLOSION rocks the building. Car alarms blare outside.\n\nAUNT MAY\nWhat was that?\n\nPeter is already moving toward his closet.\n\nPETER\nProbably just construction. I'll... check it out.\n\nEXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS\nBlack smoke billows from a high-tech laboratory building. CIVILIANS run screaming as \nmechanical tentacles smash through windows.\n\nDR. OTTO OCTAVIUS (50s), now DR. OCTOPUS, emerges from the building. Four massive \nmechanical arms extend from his back, each one destroying everything in reach.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\n(to fleeing civilians)\nDon't run! You're about to witness the birth of a new age!\n\nOne tentacle grabs a NEWS VAN and hurls it toward a group of people.\n\nEXT. NEARBY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS\nSPIDER-MAN swings into frame, red and blue costume gleaming in the morning light. He \nshoots a web-line, catches the van mid-air, and gently lowers it to safety.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(to civilians)\nEveryone okay? Good. Now might be a great time for that morning jog you've been putting \noff.\n\nSpider-Man lands gracefully, facing Dr. Octopus.\n\nSPIDER-MAN (CONT'D)\nDr. Octopus, I presume? Love the new look. Very... tentacle-y.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nSpider-Man. How predictable. Always arriving just in time to interfere with progress.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nHey, I'm all for progress. But maybe next time, try not to endanger innocent people? Just \na thought.\n\nDr. Octopus's tentacles slam into the ground where Spider-Man was standing. Spider-Man \nbackflips away effortlessly.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nThese people are merely obstacles to evolution! My fusion experiment will revolutionize \nenergy production!\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(dodging another tentacle)\nRight, because your experiments have such a great track record!\n\nSpider-Man shoots web-lines at two tentacles, yanking them together. They collide with a \nmetallic CLANG.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nEnough!\n\nAll four tentacles converge on Spider-Man's position. He leaps high into the air, spinning\n gracefully.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(mid-flip)\nYou know what they say about putting all your eggs in one basket!\n\nSpider-Man lands behind Dr. Octopus and shoots webs at his feet, temporarily anchoring \nhim.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nImpossible!\n\nDr. Octopus breaks free easily, his tentacles smashing the pavement.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nOkay, that was easier for you than I hoped.\n\nA tentacle swipes toward Spider-Man's head. His spider-sense allows him to duck just in \ntime.\n\nSPIDER-MAN (CONT'D)\nLook, Doc, I get it. Science is frustrating. Trust me, I've been there. But maybe we could\n discuss this over coffee instead of, you know, destroying half of Manhattan?\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nYou wouldn't understand! The tritium experiment was perfect! But they called it dangerous,\n shut down my funding!\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(swinging between tentacles)\nLet me guess - probably because it was actually dangerous?\n\nDr. Octopus lunges forward with all four tentacles. Spider-Man shoots web-lines to a \nnearby building and swings up to avoid the attack.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nI'll show them dangerous!\n\nDr. Octopus's tentacles grab a CITY BUS and lift it high into the air. PASSENGERS scream \ninside.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(serious now)\nPut them down. Now.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nMake me.\n\nSpider-Man's demeanor shifts. No more quips.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nWrong answer.\n\nSpider-Man swings directly at Dr. Octopus, shooting webs with pinpoint accuracy. Each \nweb-line targets the joints of the mechanical arms.\n\nThe webbing gums up the tentacles' movement. Dr. Octopus struggles to maintain his grip on\n the bus.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nWhat—? My arms!\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(while continuing his assault)\nAdvanced polymers. They'll harden and restrict movement. You've got about thirty seconds \nbefore those arms seize up completely.\n\nSpider-Man shoots a web-line at the bus and gently guides it to safety as Dr. Octopus's \ntentacles begin to malfunction.\n\nDR. OCTOPUS\nThis isn't over, Spider-Man!\n\nSPIDER-MAN\n(landing near the immobilized villain)\nActually, Doc, I think it kind of is.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION - LATER\nDr. Octopus is led away in a specially designed restraint system. CAPTAIN STACY approaches\n where Spider-Man stands with several OFFICERS.\n\nCAPTAIN STACY\nGood work today, Spider-Man. Those mechanical arms could have caused serious damage.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nJust doing what anyone with spider-powers would do, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN STACY\nAbout that interview at the Daily Bugle...\n\nSpider-Man's mask hides his surprised expression.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nI'm sorry?\n\nCAPTAIN STACY\nPeter Parker, right? My daughter Gwen mentioned you. You missed your appointment this \nmorning.\n\nSpider-Man realizes his secret identity is at risk.\n\nSPIDER-MAN\nI... think you have me confused with someone else, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN STACY\n(smiling knowingly)\nOf course. My mistake.\n\nCaptain Stacy walks away, leaving Spider-Man wondering how much he actually knows.\n\nEXT. DAILY BUGLE BUILDING - LATER\nSpider-Man swings away from the scene. The camera pulls back to reveal the Daily Bugle \nbuilding in the distance.\n\nSPIDER-MAN (V.O.)\nWith great power comes great responsibility. But sometimes, great responsibility means \nbeing late for job interviews, missing family dinners, and hoping the people you care \nabout never figure out why.\n\nINT. DAILY BUGLE - J. JONAH JAMESON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nJ. JONAH JAMESON (60s) slams a newspaper on his desk. The headline reads: \"SPIDER-MAN \nSAVES MANHATTAN.\"\n\nJ. JONAH JAMESON\n(to his secretary)\nGet me pictures of Spider-Man! I want to know everything about this masked menace!\n\nHe pauses, looking at the heroic photo of Spider-Man saving the bus.\n\nJ. JONAH JAMESON (CONT'D)\n(grudgingly)\nAnd... maybe run a small piece about the people he saved. Very small.\n\nEXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\nPeter Parker, back in civilian clothes, approaches his building. He's carrying flowers and\n Chinese takeout.\n\nPETER\n(to himself)\nAunt May loves kung pao chicken. Maybe she'll forgive me for disappearing this morning.\n\nHis spider-sense tingles faintly. Peter looks around but sees nothing suspicious.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\n(sighs)\nOr maybe I'm just paranoid.\n\nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\nPeter enters to find Aunt May reading the newspaper with Spider-Man on the front page.\n\nAUNT MAY\nPeter! You're home. How did the interview go?\n\nPETER\n(sitting down)\nLet's just say it was... eventful.\n\nAUNT MAY\n(showing him the newspaper)\nDid you hear about this Spider-Man fellow? Quite the hero.\n\nPeter tries to look casual while glancing at his own photo.\n\nPETER\nYeah, I heard something about that. Seems like a decent guy.\n\nAUNT MAY\nYour Uncle Ben would have liked him. Someone who helps others, no matter the cost to \nhimself.\n\nPeter's expression grows serious.\n\nPETER\nAunt May...\n\nAUNT MAY\n(standing up)\nWell, I better let you get some rest. You look tired, dear.\n\nShe kisses his forehead and heads toward her room.\n\nAUNT MAY (CONT'D)\n(at the doorway)\nOh, and Peter? Next time you go web-slinging around the city, try not to tear your good \nshirt.\n\nShe exits, leaving Peter staring in shock at his torn sleeve - a tear he hadn't noticed \nfrom the fight.\n\nPETER\n(to himself)\nHow does she always know?\n\nPeter looks out his window at the New York skyline. Distant sirens wail in the night.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\n(standing up)\nLooks like it's going to be another long night.\n\nHe moves toward his closet where his Spider-Man costume hangs hidden behind his regular \nclothes.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE END\n\nSPIDER-MAN WILL RETURN IN:\n\"WEB OF SHADOWS: CHAPTER TWO\"\n","metadata":{"title":"Spider-Man: Web of Shadows","author":"Script Processing System","processed_at":"2025-07-07T17:11:38.689269"}}}]}
