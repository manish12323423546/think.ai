## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Core Files Created/Modified:

1. **Type Definitions**
   - `types/globals.d.ts` - Clerk session claims interface
   - Role types and permission structures

2. **Database Schema**
   - `db/schema/customers.ts` - Extended with role fields
   - Added `projects` table for project-based access control
   - New fields: `role`, `permissions`, `projectAccess`, `profile`

3. **Role Management**
   - `lib/roles.ts` - Complete role and permission management
   - Server-side role checking functions
   - Permission hierarchy and access control

4. **Client-Side Hooks**
   - `hooks/use-roles.ts` - React hooks for role checking
   - `hooks/use-project-access.ts` - Project-specific access control

5. **Authentication Components**
   - `components/auth/role-gate.tsx` - Conditional rendering based on roles
   - Pre-built role-specific components (AdminOnly, WriterOnly, etc.)

6. **Enhanced Signup Flow**
   - `app/(unauthenticated)/(marketing)/(auth)/signup/[[...signup]]/page.tsx`
   - Role selection during signup process
   - `app/role-selection/page.tsx` - Post-signup role configuration

7. **Middleware Protection**
   - `middleware.ts` - Route-based role protection
   - Automatic role verification and redirection

8. **Dashboard System**
   - Role-specific navigation in sidebar
   - `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/_components/role-based-dashboard.tsx`
   - Different dashboard content based on roles

## 🔒 Security Features

### Permission System
- **Granular Permissions**: 15+ specific permissions (projects:create, scripts:edit, etc.)
- **Role Hierarchy**: Admin > Producer > Director > Writer/Artist > Team Member
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-level access control
- **Component-Level Guards**: Conditional rendering based on permissions

### Access Control
- **Project-Based Access**: Users can be granted access to specific projects
- **Module Restrictions**: Role-based access to different app modules
- **API Protection**: Server-side permission checking
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users redirected based on insufficient permissions

## 🎨 User Experience

### Signup Flow
1. **Role Selection**: Visual role cards during signup
2. **Permission Preview**: Users see what they'll have access to
3. **Post-Signup Configuration**: Detailed role selection page
4. **Immediate Access**: Role-based dashboard upon completion

### Dashboard Experience
- **Role-Specific Stats**: Relevant metrics for each role
- **Contextual Actions**: Quick actions based on permissions
- **Permission Visibility**: Users can see their current permissions
- **Role Switching**: Easy role change functionality

### Navigation
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: Shows only relevant navigation items
- **Role Indicators**: Clear role identification in UI
- **Breadcrumb Context**: Role-aware breadcrumb navigation

## 🔧 Configuration & Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
# Database and Stripe variables remain the same
```

### Database Migration
A new migration has been generated (`0001_salty_mongoose.sql`) that includes:
- Role enum addition
- Extended customer table with role fields
- New projects table for project-based access control

### Clerk Configuration
The system uses Clerk's metadata approach:
- **Public Metadata**: Stores user role and permissions
- **Session Claims**: Available in middleware and server components
- **Client Access**: Role information available in client components

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Role-Based Component Rendering
```tsx
import { AdminOnly, WriterOnly, RoleGate } from "@/components/auth/role-gate"

// Admin-only content
<AdminOnly>
  <AdminPanel />
</AdminOnly>

// Permission-based content
<RoleGate requiredPermissions={['scripts:edit']}>
  <ScriptEditor />
</RoleGate>
```

### Server-Side Role Checking
```tsx
import { checkRole, checkPermission } from "@/lib/roles"

// In server components
const isAdmin = await checkRole('admin')
const canEditScripts = await checkPermission('scripts:edit')
```

### Client-Side Hooks
```tsx
import { useRole, useRoleAccess } from "@/hooks/use-roles"

function MyComponent() {
  const { role, hasPermission } = useRole()
  const { canEditScripts } = useRoleAccess()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {canEditScripts && <ScriptEditor />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Enhanced Security**
- Granular permission control
- Route-level protection
- Automatic access validation

### 2. **Improved UX**
- Role-specific interfaces
- Contextual navigation
- Clear permission visibility

### 3. **Scalable Architecture**
- Easy to add new roles
- Flexible permission system
- Project-based access control

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Type-safe role checking
- Reusable components
- Comprehensive hooks

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Run Migration**: Execute `npx drizzle-kit migrate` to update database
2. **Test Signup Flow**: Create test accounts with different roles
3. **Configure Clerk**: Ensure metadata permissions are enabled

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Role Management UI**: Admin interface for managing user roles
2. **Project Invitations**: Invite users to specific projects
3. **Advanced Permissions**: Time-based or conditional permissions
4. **Audit Logging**: Track role and permission changes

## 🎉 Conclusion

Your McKay's App Template now has a production-ready, role-based authentication system that provides:

- **6 distinct user roles** with specific permissions
- **15+ granular permissions** for fine-grained access control
- **Role-specific dashboards** with contextual interfaces
- **Secure route protection** at middleware level
- **Project-based access control** for collaborative features
- **Seamless user experience** with guided role selection

The system is built using Clerk's best practices for metadata-based RBAC and follows modern React patterns for optimal performance and maintainability.
