## üîÑ **Data Flow & Integration Architecture**

### **Frontend State Management**
```typescript
// Location: /lib/contexts/script-data-context.tsx
// Comprehensive state management for all AI agent data

interface ScriptDataContextType {
  scriptData: ScriptData | null              // Agent 1: Script Ingestion
  oneLinerData: OneLinerData | null          // Agent 3: One-Liner Generation
  characterData: CharacterData | null        // Agent 2: Character Breakdown
  scheduleData: ScheduleData | null          // Agent 4: Scheduling
  storyboardData: StoryboardData | null      // Agent 6: Storyboard
  budgetData: BudgetData | null              // Agent 5: Budgeting
  
  // Workflow dependency checking
  canProceedToTab: (tabName: string) => boolean
}

// Workflow Dependencies:
1. script-analysis     ‚Üê requires scriptData
2. one-liner          ‚Üê requires scriptData  
3. character-breakdown ‚Üê requires scriptData + oneLinerData
4. schedule           ‚Üê requires scriptData + characterData
5. budget             ‚Üê requires scriptData + scheduleData
6. storyboard         ‚Üê requires scriptData
7. project-overview   ‚Üê requires scriptData
```

### **API Integration Layer**
```typescript
// Location: /app/api/sd1/[...path]/route.ts
// Proxy system for frontend-backend communication

// Request Flow:
Frontend Component ‚Üí Next.js API Route ‚Üí SD1 Backend Agent ‚Üí Database Storage

// Authentication & Authorization:
- Clerk user authentication
- Role-based permission checking
- User context passed to SD1 backend
- Request logging and monitoring
```

### **Database Schema Integration**
```sql
-- Core AI Data Tables
scripts              -- Raw and processed script data
scriptAnalysis       -- Analysis results by type and agent
oneLiners           -- Generated pitches and scene summaries  
characterBreakdowns -- Character profiles and relationships
schedules           -- Production schedules and crew allocation
budgets             -- Budget breakdowns and cost analysis
storyboards         -- Visual storyboard data and assets

-- Relationships:
All AI data linked to projects and users
Comprehensive audit trail with timestamps
Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
```
